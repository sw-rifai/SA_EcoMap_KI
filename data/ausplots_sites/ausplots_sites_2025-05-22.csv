Other palatable species such as Astrebla sp. have minimal sign of grazing since the last rain. The research station is currently in the process of destocking. Long unburnt with no evidence of past fire. Nearest infrastructure is the paddock fence line and access track approximately south east 30m from the SE corner. Site is homogenous, extending from the centre 150m to the east, 200m to the south, and at least 300m to the north and west.

The site is a Eucalyptus pauciflora, Eucalyptus viminalis and Eucalyptus laevopinea woodland, with a mid-story of young Eucalypts. The ground layer is made up of a variety of grasses, forbs and weedy  species including Geranium sp., Poa labillardierei, Hydrocotyle, Swainsona, White paper daisy and Long leaved lomandra. 
The sites land form and element hasn’t changed since the previous visit, still a hill slope and the element mountains. There is a volcanic plug to the South west of the site. There is a drainage line throughout the northern edge of the site and curves over towards the south west corner. 
The site was burnt in 2019 in a wildfire, so it has burnt since our previous visit. Some of the trees have been killed off completely, however many are shooting epicormic growth. A large part of the canopy is intact suggesting the fire was a low intensity. 
In terms of climate and response, there was a good summer rain so the site is very green. Recent rain in the past few days. The vegetation response is fruiting and flowering, including Erodium and paper daisies. The eucalypts are not fruiting or flowering. The grasses have seed heads. Less grass cover compared to the previous visit, with more forbs visible. Increased weedy species since last visit.

Previously burnt in a control burn (2016/17), but remains unburnt in the most recent fires. There are many more species in the regrowth, which were not collected the first time.
The physical description hasn’t changed.
The site is Eucalyptus pauciflora open woodland, with Eucalyptus viminalis scattered through the site. The mid-story is quite sparse with some regrowth of the Eucalypts and the Red-stemmed shrub, and the ground layer is very diverse with lots of forbs and Poa labillardierei.
The site is wet, there have been decent rains in the past few days so the soil is still damp. The vegetation response is fruiting and flowering. There are fruit on the Eucalyptus pauciflora, and many of the forbs are flowering, Lomandra has fruit and the Poa species have seed heads.
More introduced species recorded on this visit. There is Black thistle scattered throughout the site, as well as a few weedy forbs.

To the north and east the vegetation community transitions to mulga woodland but the Corymbia woodland continues another 200m to the south and west. The nearest infrastructure is a dirt road about 700m to the north. The site was burnt in October 2017 with approximately half of the site burnt on a diagonal from the north-west to the south east corner, although this scar is less pronounced now. The impact of grazing and introduced weeds is minimal.

Introduced plant impact is low, with a small amount of Cenchrus ciliaris observed at the southern end of the site. Grazing impact is high due to the close proximity of the stock watering point. All Maireanas have been modified by grazing, as has Atalaya hemiglauca and Ptilotus obovatus. Numerous tussock grasses present, but all are very small and grazed closed to the ground, making identification very uncertain. There are numerous stock pads running through the site, with frequent prints and dung away from the pads. Fire history – no evidence of past fire.

The site is homogenous but is mainly confined to the plot. Vegetation changes with slope to the north (samphire transitioning to Senna and Eremophila) and south; to the east there is more senna, and to the west it continues for up to 400m but is more impacted by grazing. Nearest infrastructure is a fenceline access track 90m northeast of the NE corner. The stock watering point is located 400m WNW of the NW corner. The Stuart Highway is 1.1km NW of the NW corner.

Site is on a dune crest on a longitudinal dune. The eastern side is most steep, with a slope of approximately 30 degrees, while the western side is less steep, with a slope of approximately 5 degrees. No surface strew or outcrop.

Introduced plant species impact is minimal. Grazing impact is minimal. Fire history – site was last burnt in 2011. Site is not entirely homogenous, as there is more canegrass on the eastern side of the dune and more Triodia on the western side of the dune. The tussock grass and forb layer is consistent throughout. The vegetation community is confined to the deeper sand of the dune and extends at least 200m northwest and southeast from the centre of the plot, but not east and west into the dune swale.

Nearest infrastructure is the Colson Track, running parallel to and approximately 35-65m from the eastern boundary.

The site is located on an alluvial plain, with a shallow drainage channel running through the middle from northwest to southeast. The site slopes towards the southeast by a degree or two.

Introduced plant species impact is minimal. Grazing impact is light, with old cattle dung and tracks still visible in the site. Astrebla pectinata, Sporobolus actinocladus and Tripogonella loliiformis tussocks have been modified. Fire history – no sign of previous fire. The site is not homogenous, with vegetation changing in association with the drainage line to support more sedge species and aquatic plants such as Marsilea. Sclerolaena bicornis is also growing more densely near the drainage line. The dominant vegetation community extends at least 100m from the centre of the plot in all directions. Nearest infrastructure is a fenceline 220m northeast of the NE corner. A vehicle access track is located 500m north of the NE corner.

Dead Triodia of 0.01m usually reflects the dead bases that still reflect a collapsed ring. 

Triodia heights are to the top of live hummock leaves only, and do not include the inflorescence. Tussock grass heights include the flowering spike. Same for 0002 & 0003. 

15th May rain overnight from 14th so transects 7 to 10 the tussock grasses are a little shorter due to weight of water. Overcast, steady drizzle overnight. 

There are parallels here to drought death (+/- senescence) of Grevilleas at Boorabbin sandplain, WAT, sites. Many mature Grevillea pinnatifid plants were dead outside the plot. 

There was heavy grazing of Rhagodia 005316 and 005335; the former was cut severely to thick hard wood. 

 With Triodia seedlings at ~10 leaf stage and resprouting bases not yet merged. Aluta seedlings were only small 3-5cm; and in patchy clusters of 5-15 plants. There were significant bare areas.

Western Desert NTS maps indicated the most recent fire was in 2012. Cover will change as Triodia and shrubs increase in bulk.
